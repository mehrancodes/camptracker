You understand and agree that participation in the Beta Program is voluntary and does not create a legal partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and CAMP TRACKER.

CAMP TRACKER reserves the right to modify the terms, conditions, and policies of this Beta Program from time to time, and to revoke your participation in this Beta Program at any time.  If CAMP TRACKER makes changes to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, then CAMP TRACKER will present such revised terms and conditions to you on the Beta Program web portal.
